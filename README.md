## How to deploy the image recognition system using IBM Cloud and the web interface



1. Create an IBM Cloud account and log in to the IBM Cloud console.

2. Click the **Catalog** icon in the navigation pane.

3. Search for the **Watson Visual Recognition** service and click **Create**.

4. Configure the service according to your needs, such as the pricing plan and region.

5. Click **Create** to deploy the service.

6. Once the service is deployed, you can access the web interface by clicking the **Launch** button.



## How to navigate the website



The website is divided into two main sections: **Classify** and **Train**.



* **Classify** allows you to classify images using your trained model.

* **Train** allows you to train a new model or update an existing model.



## How to update content



To update the content on the website, you must edit the HTML files in the `public` directory.



Once you have made your changes, save the files and deploy the website using your preferred method.



## Dependencies



* IBM Cloud account

* Watson Visual Recognition service



## README file



**Welcome to the README file for the image recognition system using IBM Cloud and the web interface!**



This system allows you to classify images using a trained Watson Visual Recognition model. You can also train your own model using the web interface.



**To deploy the system:**



1. Create an IBM Cloud account and log in to the IBM Cloud console.

2. Click the **Catalog** icon in the navigation pane.

3. Search for the **Watson Visual Recognition** service and click **Create**.

4. Configure the service according to your needs, such as the pricing plan and region.

5. Click **Create** to deploy the service.

6. Once the service is deployed, you can access the web interface by clicking the **Launch** button.



**To classify images:**



1. Log in to the web interface.

2. Click the **Classify** tab.

3. Click the **Upload image** button and select an image to classify.

4. Click the **Classify** button.

5. The system will classify the image and display the results.



**To train a model:**



1. Log in to the web interface.

2. Click the **Train** tab.

3. Click the **Create new model** button.

4. Enter a name for your model and select the classes you want to train your model to classify.

5. Click the **Create** button.

6. Click the **Add images** button and select the images you want to use to train your model.

7. Click the **Train** button.

8. Once the model is trained, you can use it to classify images by clicking the **Classify** tab.
